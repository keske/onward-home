# Onward

## Description

Here is my implementation of the homework.

A few words about:

- I started the project with a bunch of `eslint` rules which helps keep the code base consistency. Rules are opinionated and they are my favorite;
- I'm using `zustand` as the global state manager;
- For styles here is `tailwind`;
- Components are written to be ready to scale and for production, for example `<Button />`;
- I'm using different approaches like `React.useImperativeHandle` to show my understanding of React;
- Room to improve: tests, ts errors;

## Run

```sh
$ yarn
$ yarn dev
```
