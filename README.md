# Onward

[DEMO](https://onward-home.vercel.app)

## Description

Here is my implementation of the homework.

A few words about:

- I started the project with a bunch of `eslint` rules which helps keep the code base consistent. Rules are opinionated and they are my favorite;
- I'm using `zustand` as the global state manager (I'm familiar with React Context, Redux & MobX);
- For styles here is `tailwind` (moreover, I've worked with JSX, SCSS, Style Components, and other libs);
- Components are written to be ready to scale and for production, for example `<Button />`;
- I'm using different approaches like `React.useImperativeHandle` to show my understanding of React;
- Room to improve: tests, responsiveness;

## Run

```sh
$ yarn
$ yarn dev
```
